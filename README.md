### Idea: Simple Book Library Application

#### Overview
Create a small microservice application with two services:
1. **Book Service**: Manages the catalog of books.
2. **Review Service**: Allows users to add and retrieve reviews for books.

### Services and Their Responsibilities

**Book Service**:
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /books`: Retrieve a list of all books.
  - `GET /books/{book_id}`: Retrieve details of a specific book by its ID.
  - `POST /books`: Add a new book to the catalog.
  - `PUT /books/{book_id}`: Update details of an existing book.
  - `DELETE /books/{book_id}`: Remove a book from the catalog.

**Review Service**:
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /reviews/{book_id}`: Retrieve all reviews for a specific book.
  - `POST /reviews/{book_id}`: Add a new review for a specific book.
  - `PUT /reviews/{review_id}`: Update an existing review.
  - `DELETE /reviews/{review_id}`: Delete a review.

### Example Use Case

#### 1. Book Service
- **Retrieve Books**: A user can view all books available in the library.
- **Book Details**: A user can get detailed information about a specific book, such as the title, author, and summary.
- **Manage Books**: An admin can add new books, update existing book details, or remove books from the catalog.

#### 2. Review Service
- **View Reviews**: A user can read reviews for a specific book to help decide if they want to read it.
- **Add Review**: A user can submit a review for a book they have read.
- **Update/Delete Review**: A user can modify or delete their own reviews.

### Example Scenario

1. **User Browses Books**:
   - The user sends a GET request to the Book Service endpoint `/books` and receives a list of books.

2. **User Views Book Details**:
   - The user selects a book and sends a GET request to `/books/{book_id}` to view its details.

3. **User Reads Reviews**:
   - The user sends a GET request to the Review Service endpoint `/reviews/{book_id}` to read reviews for the selected book.

4. **User Adds a Review**:
   - After reading the book, the user sends a POST request to `/reviews/{book_id}` with their review content.

5. **User Updates or Deletes Review**:
   - The user can send a PUT request to `/reviews/{review_id}` to update their review or a DELETE request to remove it.

### Deployment and Scaling
- **Containerization**: Use Docker to containerize each service for consistent and isolated environments.
- **Orchestration**: Use Docker Compose or Kubernetes to manage the deployment of both services.
- **Database**: Use separate databases for each service to maintain independence, such as a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for the Book Service and a document-based database (e.g., MongoDB) for the Review Service.

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Logging**: Implement logging to track requests and errors in each service.
- **Monitoring**: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the health and performance of the services.
- **Scaling**: Ensure that each service can be scaled independently based on demand, such as adding more instances of the Review Service if it receives high traffic.

This simple book library application demonstrates how microservices can be used to build a scalable and maintainable system with clear separation of concerns.

# Communication Between Services

To link reviews to valid books, the Review Service will communicate with the Book Service to ensure that the book ID exists and to retrieve book details when needed. This is done through HTTP requests between the services.

## Basic Workflow

- **User Requests:** When a user interacts with the application (e.g., viewing a book's details or submitting a review), the application sends requests to the relevant services.
- **Service Coordination:** The services coordinate to process these requests and provide the necessary data.

## Scenario Walkthrough

### User Browses Books

- The user sends a `GET` request to the Book Service endpoint `/books` and receives a list of books.

### User Views Book Details

- The user selects a book and sends a `GET` request to `/books/{book_id}` to view its details.

### User Reads Reviews

- The user sends a `GET` request to the Review Service endpoint `/reviews/{book_id}` to read reviews for the selected book.
- The Review Service, to ensure the book exists and get its details, sends a `GET` request to the Book Service at `/books/{book_id}`.
- Once the Book Service confirms the book's existence, the Review Service retrieves the reviews from its database and returns them to the user.

### User Adds a Review

- After reading the book, the user submits a review by sending a `POST` request to `/reviews/{book_id}` with the review content.
- The Review Service validates the book ID by sending a `GET` request to the Book Service at `/books/{book_id}`.
- Once validated, the Review Service saves the review to its database and acknowledges the submission to the user.

### User Updates or Deletes Review

- To update or delete a review, the user sends a `PUT` or `DELETE` request to `/reviews/{review_id}`.
- The Review Service processes the request, updates or deletes the review in its database, and responds to the user.

## Communication Protocol

- **HTTP Requests:** The services communicate via HTTP requests, where one service makes a request to an endpoint exposed by another service.
- **Service Discovery:** Each service knows the address and endpoints of the other service, enabling them to send requests accurately.

## Error Handling

- **Validation:** Before any action, the Review Service validates book IDs by checking with the Book Service to prevent invalid reviews.
- **Failure Response:** If a book ID is not found, the Book Service returns an error response, which the Review Service then relays to the user.

## Example API Requests

### Review Service Validates Book ID

```http
GET /books/{book_id} HTTP/1.1
Host: book-service.example.com
```

```Response
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Book One",
  "author": "Author One",
  "summary": "Summary One"
}
```
If the book ID is valid, the Review Service processes the review.

```User Submits Review
POST /reviews/{book_id} HTTP/1.1
Host: review-service.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "review_id": 101,
  "content": "Great book!",
  "rating": 5
}
```
```Response:
{
  "message": "Review added successfully"
}

```
