### Idea: Simple Blogging Platform

#### Overview
Create a small microservice application with two services:
1. **Post Service**: Manages the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of blog posts.
2. **Comment Service**: Handles comments on blog posts.

### Services and Their Responsibilities

**Post Service**:
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /posts`: Retrieve a list of all blog posts.
  - `GET /posts/{post_id}`: Retrieve details of a specific post by its ID.
  - `POST /posts`: Create a new blog post.
  - `PUT /posts/{post_id}`: Update details of an existing blog post.
  - `DELETE /posts/{post_id}`: Delete a blog post.

**Comment Service**:
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /comments/{post_id}`: Retrieve all comments for a specific blog post.
  - `POST /comments/{post_id}`: Add a new comment to a specific blog post.
  - `PUT /comments/{comment_id}`: Update an existing comment.
  - `DELETE /comments/{comment_id}`: Delete a comment.

### Example Use Case

#### 1. Post Service
- **Retrieve Posts**: Users can view all blog posts.
- **Post Details**: Users can get detailed information about a specific blog post, such as the title, content, and author.
- **Manage Posts**: Authors can create new blog posts, update existing posts, or delete their posts.

#### 2. Comment Service
- **View Comments**: Users can read comments on a specific blog post.
- **Add Comment**: Users can submit comments on a blog post they have read.
- **Update/Delete Comment**: Users can modify or delete their own comments.

### Communication Between Services
The Comment Service will need to fetch post details from the Post Service to ensure that comments are linked to valid posts. This can be done through HTTP requests between the services.

### Example Scenario

1. **User Browses Posts**:
   - The user sends a GET request to the Post Service endpoint `/posts` and receives a list of blog posts.

2. **User Views Post Details**:
   - The user selects a post and sends a GET request to `/posts/{post_id}` to view its details.

3. **User Reads Comments**:
   - The user sends a GET request to the Comment Service endpoint `/comments/{post_id}` to read comments for the selected post.

4. **User Adds a Comment**:
   - After reading the post, the user sends a POST request to `/comments/{post_id}` with their comment content.

5. **User Updates or Deletes Comment**:
   - The user can send a PUT request to `/comments/{comment_id}` to update their comment or a DELETE request to remove it.

### Deployment and Scaling
- **Containerization**: Use Docker to containerize each service for consistent and isolated environments.
- **Orchestration**: Use Docker Compose or Kubernetes to manage the deployment of both services.
- **Database**: Use separate databases for each service to maintain independence, such as a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for the Post Service and a document-based database (e.g., MongoDB) for the Comment Service.

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Logging**: Implement logging to track requests and errors in each service.
- **Monitoring**: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the health and performance of the services.
- **Scaling**: Ensure that each service can be scaled independently based on demand, such as adding more instances of the Comment Service if it receives high traffic.

This simple blogging platform demonstrates how microservices can be used to build a scalable and maintainable system with clear separation of concerns.
